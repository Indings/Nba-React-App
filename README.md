# Nba-React-App

Welcome to my first react project! The goal of this project was to learn the react framework as well as gain more experience with dotnet and plain js

This app is a player stat tracker/lookup app that allows users to track their favorite players as well as create fantasy teams. 

this app uses the balldontlie api as well as an official NBA JSON file to allow for the data/asset retrieval.
